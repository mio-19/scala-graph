/** Represents a flight between two airports.
  *
  * This object defines the edge type `Flight` needed for the flight route map example as a custom edge type.
  *
  * A `Flight` has several attributes like `departure` and `duration`.
  * To enable duplicate flights between airports, `flightNo` is added to the key attributes.
  *
  * Note that this is not a real-life design. For instance, calculating the shortest path does not consider
  * waiting times on the airports, it just uses the flight duration.
  *
  * For a usage example see TFlight.scala.
  *
  * @param departure The departure airport
  * @param destination The destination airport
  * @param flightNo The flight Id as a key attribute consisting of the airline short and a flight number of that airline.
  * @param departureAt daytime of departure
  * @param duration of flight
